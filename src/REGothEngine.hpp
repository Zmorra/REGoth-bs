   * most of the utilities set up to load original content and game mechanics.
   *
   * Therefore, the REGothEngine-class can be used to implement viewers and other tools
   * as well as the actual reimplementation of the Gothic games.

   *
   *  - getVdfsPackagesToLoad()
   *  - setupInput()
   *  - setupScene()
   *
   * To actually run an instance of the engine, see the `main`-wrapper below.
